## Welcome to **GamingSphere** ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾!

**GamingSphere** is an interactive platform designed for gamers worldwide to connect, collaborate, and compete. At GamingSphere, users can:

- Join **game-specific communities** to find like-minded players.
- Participate in **group chats** or **private rooms** for seamless communication.
- Organize and join **tournaments** to showcase their gaming skills.
- Stay updated on the **latest gaming trends** and events.

This is a **20 points** task and is aimed at understanding **User Experience (UX)** and creating an **effective User Flow** for GamingSphere.

ðŸ˜Š **Feel free to add additional features in your User Flow that align with the gaming theme.**

---

## Procedure:

1. **Imagine the journey of a new user**:
    
    Think about how an average gamer would interact with the platform when they open GamingSphere for the first time. Consider a user who is unfamiliar with the website but is eager to explore its functionalities.
    
2. **Design a 'single flow'**:
    
    Create a user flow for a specific use case. For example:
    
    - A user wants to **join a gaming community** for their favourite game.
    - Another user might want to **host a private tournament**.
    - Or perhaps a user wants to **browse and connect with other gamers**.
    
    Decide the logical steps the user will take to accomplish their goal, from landing on the homepage to completing their desired action.
    
3. **Create a User Flow Diagram**:
    
    Use **FigJam** to design a clear, logical, and visually appealing user flow diagram for your chosen scenario.
    
4. **Submit the FigJam file link**:
    
    Compile the FigJam file link into a **.txt file** and upload it to the **UX Task Folder**.

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC):

- The user flow must fulfill **basic functionalities of the website**, such as:
    - **Signing up** or logging in.
    - Completing a specific action (e.g., joining a group, creating a tournament).
- The flow should start with the **user entering the website** and end with their **goal being achieved**.

---

> ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP: Research similar gaming platforms (like Discord, Challonge, or Steam) and analyze their user flows. This will help you design a more intuitive and feature-rich user flow.
